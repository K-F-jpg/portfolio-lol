                        I created this whilst studying abroad in Italy with the VCU Graphic Design program from May-June 2025. We were tasked with observing the city and creating designs inspired by what we saw, so I made "Modern History": an insight into modern day systems that are commonly overlooked for their consistent presence in our lives until they, too, become "history." I chose to represent the idea of a "modern history" with the unique nature of Italian street signs, which were covered in stickers, playing with the idea of the signs themselves being scraped off and cleaned but their history (the stickers) remaining a part of their "lives."

                        These were also created during my May-June studies in Italy with the VCU Graphic Design program. I created two custom screenprints of a collection of historical wall-integrated vent systems I found across my travels that I outlined in Illustrator and assembled into a pattern. I printed these on textured paper to emulate the walls in the showcase room, printing one with a faulty screen I had created to emulate the ancient broken walls found across Italy to play into its historical background. The screenprint files are featured on the PDF to the left.

                        We were required to create a zine, or some kind of publication, that talked about our identities in some way to act as a "leave-behind" for people who wanted to get to know us better; kinda like a business card, but more artsy. I took a few weeks to make a zine that I believed refleccted my personality/ identity, making it resemble a laptop/ desktop because I'm online more often than not; so capturing that digital identity. (I made a zine capturing that digital identity). On the back, I added a magenta background and in front of that collaged some text from the front of the zine.<br>

                        This project was created for my PHTO bookmaking class' stitch book assignment. The prompt for this book was "Portrait of One Person", which I interpreted as the saying "you are what you eat"- a visualization of myself as a college student on a meal plan who occasionally splurges for the good stuff. I convey the nuances of a healthy taste in food with the brands of products I use, featuring organic labels and quality ingredients. The photographs featured in the book have been digitally altered using Photoshop to give them a brighter appearance and play into the notion that they're being lit with a fridge light.

                        This absolute behemoth was created in the last month of my Sophomore year, in Core Studio 2. This was an assignment to create a 500-page book on the topic of "speculative worlds," looking into the past, present, and future of our topic. I chose to research "Beauty," exploring concepts of beauty standards between women and men throughout history. I also incorporated a bit of a fashion perspective, but my focus was primarily on beauty and its evolution to more synthetic appearances in the present day.<br>I started from the beginning of time because I wanted to delve into attraction and appearances at a fundamental level, then I worked through the most pertinent centuries and eras in beauty (Greece, Rome, 14th, 15th, 16th centuries), and finally from the late 1800s- present day by the decade. For the speculative portion, I explored AI in beauty as it's being used today, and how its role can also can evolve in the future.<br><br>I used mirror paper for the cover, drawing on it in lipstick; this decision was inspired by bathroom medicine cabinets, which are typically used to store a myriad of beautification products.

                        For this assignment, we had to create 3 title cards from 3 screenshots of a music video. I chose Magdalena Bay's "Secrets: Your Fire", and used this assignment as a method to test my flexibility in design thinking. We were also tasked with creating a short animation using one of our 3 title cards in Adobe AfterEffects; I chose the first in the series, which you can watch by clicking on the link provided below.<br><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kFs6CtMKS4uqlhAXSDd_hEEf1hSxczHe/view?t=1" style="text-align: center; color: white;">WATCH HERE!!</a>
